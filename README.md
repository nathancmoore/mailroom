# mailroom

This is an application which allows the user to simulate writing automatically-generated
thank you messages to donors to their organization. It contains a dictionary of donors
each with a list of past donations. Through the command line, the user can look at a complete
report of all donors and their donations, as well as add new donations to existing donors,
or add a new donor to the dictionary, paired with the value of the donation. Each of the last two
options will result in the user receiving and automatically-generated email to send to the user,
which presumably they would copy-paste into an email.

There is also functionality to allow the user to quit or restart the program at any time 
by entering "quit" or "restart" into the command line, respectively.
